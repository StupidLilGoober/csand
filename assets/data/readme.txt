the save file format
*******************************
Each value is seperated by a space.

The values are the actual grid. Each row on the
grid is represented by an actual new row in the file.
Then, each cell in that row is represented by the
values. The result is a huge (620x360) grid of just
numbers.

This format is easy to parse and easy to manually edit
